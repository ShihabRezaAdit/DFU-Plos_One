# DFU DIALNet: Towards Reliable and Trustworthy Diabetic Foot Ulcer Detection with Synergistic Confluence of Grad-CAM and LIME

This project focuses on using machine learning and deep learning to detect diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). The novel DFU_DIALNet approach achieved an accuracy of 99.33%, and the model decisions are interpreted using LIME and Grad-CAM.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: DFU_DIALNet achieves 99.33% accuracy.
- **Interpretability**: LIME and Grad-CAM are used to explain the model's decisions.
- **Web Application**: A complete web app to predict foot ulcers.

## Dataset
1. [DFUC 2021](https://dfu-challenge.github.io/dfuc2021.html)
2. [DFUC 2020](https://dfu-challenge.github.io/dfuc2020.html)
3. [Kaggle DFU](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laithjj/diabetic-foot-ulcer-dfu)
